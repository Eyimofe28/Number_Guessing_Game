# Number_Guessing_Game
This Python code implements a text based number guessing game where the player has to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The `chances` function evaluates the player's guess and provides feedback (too low, too high, or correct), reducing the remaining attempts. The `game` function initializes the game, prompting the player to guess within a specified number of attempts. The `game_level` function determines the difficulty level (easy or hard) and calls the `game` function accordingly. The main loop allows the player to replay the game, choose the difficulty level, and exits on user input ('y', 'n', or other). Overall, the code offers an interactive number guessing game with adjustable difficulty levels and replayability.
